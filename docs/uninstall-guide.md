## Verification and Validation (Enhanced v2.4.0)

### Comprehensive Verification
```bash
# Use enhanced verification command
sudo ./uninstall_script.sh verify

# Manual verification checks
echo "=== Manual Verification Checklist ==="

# 1. Check for remaining files
echo "Checking for remaining files..."
find /usr/local -name "*jamf_connect_monitor*" 2>/dev/null || echo "‚úÖ No files found"
find /Library -name "*jamfconnectmonitor*" 2>/dev/null || echo "‚úÖ No files found"

# 2. Check for running processes
echo "Checking for running processes..."
pgrep -f jamf_connect_monitor && echo "‚ùå Processes still running" || echo "‚úÖ No processes running"

# 3. Check LaunchDaemon registration
echo "Checking LaunchDaemon registration..."
launchctl list | grep jamfconnectmonitor && echo "‚ùå Still registered" || echo "‚úÖ Not registered"

# 4. Check package receipts
echo "Checking package receipts..."
pkgutil --pkg-info com.macjediwizard.jamfconnectmonitor 2>/dev/null && echo "‚ùå Receipt found" || echo "‚úÖ No receipts"

# 5. Verify backup creation
echo "Checking backup creation..."
ls -la /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor_archive_* 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Logs archived" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No archive found"
ls -la /usr/local/etc/*.uninstall_backup.* 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Configs backed up" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No backups found"
```

### Jamf Pro Integration Verification
```bash
# After mass uninstall via Jamf Pro:
# 1. Check Smart Group "Successfully Removed" for expected membership
# 2. Verify Extension Attribute shows "Not configured" 
# 3. Confirm inventory updates completed
# 4. Validate no monitoring processes running on sample systems
```

## Troubleshooting Enhanced Uninstall (v2.4.0)

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Permission Denied During Uninstall
```bash
# Solution: Ensure running with sudo and clear ACLs
sudo xattr -c ./uninstall_script.sh
sudo chmod +x ./uninstall_script.sh
sudo ./uninstall_script.sh --force
```

#### LaunchDaemon Won't Unload
```bash
# Enhanced v2.4.0 uninstall handles this automatically, but manual fix:
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macjediwizard.jamfconnectmonitor.plist
sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macjediwizard.jamfconnectmonitor.plist

# Force kill processes if needed:
sudo pkill -f jamf_connect_monitor
```

#### Package Receipts Not Removed
```bash
# Enhanced v2.4.0 uninstall handles multiple package IDs, but manual cleanup:
sudo pkgutil --forget com.macjediwizard.jamfconnectmonitor
sudo pkgutil --forget com.yourcompany.jamfconnectmonitor  
sudo pkgutil --forget com.company.jamfconnectmonitor
```

#### Incomplete Removal
```bash
# Use enhanced verification and cleanup
sudo ./uninstall_script.sh verify

# If issues found, re-run enhanced uninstall:
sudo ./uninstall_script.sh --force

# Check specific components manually:
sudo find /usr/local -name "*jamf_connect_monitor*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
sudo find /Library -name "*jamfconnectmonitor*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

#### Backup and Archive Issues
```bash
# Check backup creation
ls -la /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor_archive_*
ls -la /usr/local/etc/*.uninstall_backup.*

# If backups missing, check disk space:
df -h /var/log
df -h /usr/local

# Manually create backup if needed before uninstall:
sudo cp -R /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor_manual_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

## Backup and Recovery (v2.4.0 Feature)

### Restoring from Enhanced Backups
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor_archive_*
ls -la /usr/local/etc/*.uninstall_backup.*

# Restore approved admin list:
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/approved_admins.txt.uninstall_backup.[timestamp] /usr/local/etc/approved_admins.txt

# Restore configuration:
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/jamf_connect_monitor.conf.uninstall_backup.[timestamp] /usr/local/etc/jamf_connect_monitor.conf

# Restore logs from archive:
sudo cp -R /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor_archive_[timestamp]/* /var/log/jamf_connect_monitor/
```

### Partial Reinstallation (After Enhanced Uninstall)
```bash
# If you need to reinstall after enhanced uninstall:
# 1. Download latest package
curl -LO https://github.com/MacJediWizard/jamf-connect-monitor/releases/latest/download/JamfConnectMonitor-2.4.0.pkg

# 2. Install package
sudo installer -pkg JamfConnectMonitor-2.4.0.pkg -target /

# 3. Restore approved admin list from backup (if needed)
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/approved_admins.txt.uninstall_backup.[timestamp] /usr/local/etc/approved_admins.txt

# 4. Verify installation with v2.4.0 tools
sudo ./tools/verify_monitoring.sh
```
