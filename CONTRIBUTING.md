# Parameters: $1 - username to check
# Returns: 0 if admin, 1 if not admin
check_admin_status() {
    local username="$1"
    
    if [[ -z "$username" ]]; then
        log_message "ERROR" "Username parameter required"
        return 1
    fi
    
    if dsmemberutil checkmembership -U "$username" -G admin | grep -q "user is a member"; then
        log_message "INFO" "User $username has admin privileges"
        return 0
    else
        log_message "INFO" "User $username does not have admin privileges"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update documentation with any functional changes
- Follow Markdown best practices

### Commit Messages
